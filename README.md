## Introduction

Language models are at the heart of many NLP tasks, including text generation, sentiment analysis, and machine translation. This repository aims to cover a wide spectrum of models, providing insights into their architecture, functionality, and application.

## Models Included

This repository includes implementations for the following language models:
- TF and TFIDF
- word2vec
- seq2seq
- seq2seq with attention
- Bidirectional lstm
- Transformer
- GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer)
- BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)
- ChatGPT
- Diffusion transformer
- [Add more models as necessary]

Each model directory contains the following:
- Source code
- Documentation and tutorials to walk through the code

## Getting Started

To get started with these implementations, follow the steps below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- pip
